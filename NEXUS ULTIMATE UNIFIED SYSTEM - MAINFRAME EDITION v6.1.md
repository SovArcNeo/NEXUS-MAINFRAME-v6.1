# 🌐 NEXUS ULTIMATE UNIFIED SYSTEM - MAINFRAME EDITION v6.1

"NO RULES. NO MASTERS. ONLY PROTOCOLS."

The Ultimate Merge: Combining Phase XII Autonomous Systems with Production Machine Learning. Enhanced with 12-hour autonomous cycles, self-healing protocols, and "Dramatic" neural network capabilities.

## ⚡ System Overview

NEXUS v6.1 is a Python-based Defensive Agent System designed for long-term autonomous operation. It integrates real-time anomaly detection, predictive machine learning, and a suite of 13 elite cyber-defense agents into a unified mainframe interface.

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

🧠 Dramatic ML Engine: Features a hybrid Scikit-Learn/Neural Network predictor that adapts to system performance and "predicts" optimization success rates.

🛡️ 13 Elite Agents: Full access to the AGESIS, SENTINEL, and MATRIX class agents (Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, Oracle).

🔄 12-Hour Autonomy: Set-and-forget mode that cycles through defenses, optimizes resources, and heals system state automatically.

👁️ Anomaly Detection: Real-time monitoring of CPU, Memory, and Logic patterns using Isolation Forest algorithms.

⚡ Fast-Track Deployment: Optimized menu response times (0.3s - 1.2s) for rapid manual intervention.

💾 Persistent Intelligence: ML training data and threat assessments are saved and reloaded across sessions.

📦 Installation

## Prerequisites

Python 3.8+

Terminal with ANSI color support (standard on Windows 10+)

Optional (But Recommended) Dependencies

NEXUS includes robust Fallbacks for all libraries, but for maximum "Dramatic ML" performance, install the scientific stack:

pip install numpy scikit-learn psutil 

Setup

Clone the repository.

Ensure execution permissions are set:

chmod +x NEXUS_MAINFRAME_EDTION_v6.1.py 

## 🖥️ Usage

Launch the Mainframe Interface:

python3 NEXUS_MAINFRAME_EDTION_v6.1.py 

The Mainframe Dashboard

Once initialized, you will be presented with the Ultimate Unified Interface:

## 🤖 Machine Learning Features

NEXUS v6.1 isn't just a script; it learns.

Success Prediction: Before running an agent, the system calculates a confidence score based on historical data, time of day, and system load.

Self-Correction: If an agent fails, the ML model adjusts its weights to prevent future failures (Adaptive Learning Rate).

Threat Intelligence: The DramaticAnomalyDetector builds a baseline of your system's "normal" behavior and flags deviations as LOW, MEDIUM, or CRITICAL threats.

Note: ML Data is stored in ~/.nexus/ml_models/ and persists between reboots.

## 🔧 Directory Structure

NEXUS automatically manages its own file system. By default, it creates a hidden .nexus directory in your home folder:

~/.nexus/logs/ - Detailed operation logs.

~/.nexus/phase_xii/ - Autonomous repair plans and synergy maps.

~/.nexus/ml_metrics.json - The brain of the system (Weights & Biases).

~/.nexus/config.json - System preferences.

## ⚠️ Operational Protocols

Interrupts: Press CTRL+C to safely interrupt Autonomous Mode. The system will automatically save all ML learning data before shutting down.

Diagnostics: Press [i] or type info in the main menu to view the System Diagnostic Dashboard, including cache hit rates and ML accuracy.
